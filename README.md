A unified geometric framework for constrained dynamical systems based on strong transversality conditions and compatible pair theory.

## Overview

Strong transversality geometry provides a revolutionary approach to constrained systems by treating constraints not as external restrictions, but as intrinsic geometric structures. This framework unifies diverse fields including fluid dynamics, robotics, gauge field theory, and optimization.

### Key Concepts

- **Compatible Pairs (D, Î»)**: Unified representation of constraint distributions and their dual functions
- **Strong Transversality**: Geometric condition ensuring constraint-symmetry compatibility  
- **Spencer Complex**: Topological tool for discovering all conservation laws
- **Stratified Fibration**: Geometric phase transitions in constrained systems

### Why Strong Transversality?

Traditional Lagrangian methods treat constraints and dynamics separately, leading to:
- Constraint drift in numerical simulations
- Loss of conservation laws
- Instability in multi-constraint systems

Strong transversality geometry addresses these issues by:
- Preserving geometric structure automatically
- Maintaining Spencer invariants to machine precision (10^-14)
- Providing unified treatment across domains

## Quick Start

```python
from tools.compatible_pairs import CompatiblePair
from tools.spencer_invariants import compute_spencer_invariants

# Create a compatible pair for your constrained system
system = CompatiblePair(constraint_distribution, dual_function)

# Verify strong transversality condition
assert system.verify_strong_transversality()

# Compute all Spencer invariants
invariants = compute_spencer_invariants(system)
